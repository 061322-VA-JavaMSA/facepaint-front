Facepaint is a website that allows a user to manage their profile and showcase their favorite piece of art. Basic users are able to login as well as search and manage their own profiles. Searching uses the Chicago Art Institute API to search by title or artist. Administrators are able to remove users in addition to having the capabilities of a basic user.
